**Objective**:

Design and implement a Finite State Machine (FSM) that can model and control a specific system or process, such as:

  A vending machine
  
  A traffic light controller
  
  A digital clock
  
  A robotic arm
  
**Key Activities**:

 1.Requirements gathering: Define project scope, goals, and deliverables.

 2.System analysis: Study the system or process to be modeled by the FSM.

 3.State identification: Identify and define the states of the system or process.

 4.Transition definition: Define the transitions between states.

 5.State transition diagram/table creation: Create a visual representation of the FSM.

 6.FSM implementation: Write code or design hardware to implement the FSM.

 7.Simulation/testing: Verify and validate the FSM through simulation or testing.

 8.Debugging: Identify and fix errors or issues in the FSM.

 9.Optimization: Refine the FSM for efficiency, scalability, and reliability.

10.Documentation: Write a report detailing the FSM design and implementation.

11.Testing and validation: Develop test cases and report results.

12.Review and revision: Review the FSM design and implementation, and make revisions as needed.
